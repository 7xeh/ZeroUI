# 🎨 ZeroUI

A sleek, modular Discord theme for [Vencord](https://github.com/Vencord) — built directly on top of **Discord’s native themes**.  
Think of it as Discord’s default look, but **cleaner, smoother, and more polished**.

## ✨ Features
- 🖤 **Native-Inspired** – Enhances Discord’s built-in themes without breaking the core look.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight & Fast** – Minimal CSS for smooth performance.  
- 🎚️ **Refined UI** – Adjusted spacing, consistent design, and small quality-of-life improvements.  
- 🌙 **Dark Mode First** – Optimized for Discord’s native dark theme.  
- 🔄 **Actively Maintained** – Frequent updates and polish.
